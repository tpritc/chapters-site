                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed a problem which could cause chapter information to be lost after export. It was probably rare on the whole, but common for users who were unfortunate enough to be affected by it. It took an extra day and version to fully grasp the problem and put a proper fix in place, so this really is information for both 1.5.5 and 1.5.6.

                    <li>Fixed a problem with chapter start times being off when playing back the finished file. The playback engine needed an upgrade to provide better timing precision. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobtender">@jacobtender</a> for reporting the problem! </li>
                    <li>Fixed a bug with chapter durations being incorrectly set. Thanks Franco Solerio for reporting the problem!</li>

                <h3>Podcast Chapters 1.5 <small>Released May 27, 2019</small></h3>
                <p>1.5 is major on the inside: it's more or less the same nice car with a new engine. Don't worry, it still handles just the same, it just requires less maintenance, uses less fuel and will be easier to upgrade in the future!</p>
                <p>All that said, of course there are a couple of immediately useful additions too:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hidden chapters:</strong> Each chapter now has a checkbox to remove it from the chapter table of contents. This means you can have an image and/or URL show up while the podcast is playing without adding more chapters for the user to choose from. Great for easter eggs! Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobtender">@jacobtender</a> for the suggestion!</li>
                    <li><strong>Chapter with current playback time:</strong> Create a new chapter while the episode is playing, and the chapter will be set to start at the current playback time. This works both with button clicks and the CMD+N keyboard shortcut.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bug fixes:</strong> Fixed lots of problems with opening MP3:s with existing chapters. This means, for example, that if you edit your podcast in an app like <a href="https://hindenburg.com">Hindenburg</a>, you can export your MP3 including chapter information straight from there. The same should go for any other editing app supporting exporting to MP3 with chapters. Thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/tjluoma">@tjluoma</a> for some great bug reporting!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The next big feature will probably be restoring episode descriptions. It has been requested by multiple users and required this engine change to work well. I also realized while working on thus that descriptions (or comments as they're know inside the ID3 tags) have a bunch of interesting cases to handle if I don't want to mangle existing metadata. And I don't, so I will proceed with some care.</p>
                <p>Thanks again to everyone using the app, everyone who has reported a bug or a wish, and everyone else who makes it fun to develop Podcast Chapters!</p>

                <p>A very small version to mark the transition of developer for the app.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bug fix:</strong> Hopefully fixed a crash which could occur if a podcast was opened including a chapter without a title.</li>
                    <li>New developer: new copyright information, new certificates to manage. Developers out there know what a delight it can be, everyone else can ignore and be happy. (This time, a reboot was happily all that was required to solve the issue.)</li>

                <h3>Podcast Chapters 1.3 <small>Released November 20, 2017</small></h3>
                <p>This update simply would not have been possible without the incredible work of <a href="https://twitter.com/bjoreman">Fredrik Björeman</a>, who ported the entire app to Swift 3. This was no small task, and I'm incredibly indebted to him.</p>
                <p>In this update, Podcast Chapters gets a couple of new features, and fixes a few bugs that managed to creep through.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Drag-and-Drop:</strong> Fredrik has gone through and enabled drag-and-drop all over the app. You can now drag images onto the cover art or chapter image areas, saving you from using the file picker every time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export Chapters as Cue Files:</strong> As of Podcast Chapters 1.2 you could import chapter markers from <code>cue</code> files. Well now you can export to them as well! Note: Cue files only allow for a title and a timestamp, so unfortunately any URL or images associated with the chapter aren't exported.</li>
                    <li><strong>Export Chapters to Show Notes:</strong> You can now export your chapter markers in a show-note-friendly text format, perfect for listeners who don't have a client that supports MP3 Chapter Markers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bugfixes:</strong> Squashed a number of bugs, including:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dismissing the import dialog panel would crash the app before (thanks to <a href="http://danieloskarsson.com/">Daniel Oskarsson</a> for sending me their bug report).</li>
                        <li>The eagle-eyed among you might've noticed that 'Chapter Images' was incorrectly titled 'Chapter Information' in the last version. We've fixed that.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>The minimum macOS version in this update has changed to macOS Sierra.</p>

                <p>In this big update, Podcast Chapters gets a ton of new features, helping you with that annoying last part of the podcast process.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Podcast Chapters now lets you update all other kinds of MP3 metadata for publishing your podcast, including the name of your podcast, the episode's title, and your show art.</li>
                    <li><strong>Presets:</strong> You can now save a preset for a show, letting you quickly and easily fill information about the podcast, without having to find the pesky show art each time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Import Chapters:</strong> You can now import your chapters from cue files.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chapter Artwork:</strong> You can now add artwork to a chapter marker! Give it a try!</li>
                    <li><strong>Bugfixes:</strong> Squashed a number of bugs, including:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Annoying text encoding bug (thanks to <a href="http://hindenburg.com")>Preben Friis of Hindenburg Systems</a> for helping me debug this).</li>
                        <li>Conflicts between the shortcuts for jump time and screenshots. You can now use ⌥⌘1-5 to change the jump amount. This will also now update the menus! (My thanks to Ali Moosa for their help with this)</li>
                        <li>A number of VoiceOver bugs.</li>
