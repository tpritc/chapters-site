                <h3>What podcast clients can I view MP3 chapter markers in?</h3>
                <p>Most third-party podcast clients can view MP3 chapter markers. You can get an idea of the podcast clients that support MP3 chapter markers using <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c2L14UVH1xtN4iDG4awheLbMgPCQgaKEamUauWs1gps/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> (you'll want column W). Please note it's not entirely up-to-date, with MP3 chapter markers quickly gaining adoption across the spectrum of podcast clients.</p>
                <p>The big podcast client that cannot is Podcasts for iOS (and iTunes for macOS), and this is a known issue. There is a radar filed at <code>#24883412</code>, and we hope Apple will fix Podcasts for iOS and iTunes for macOS to support MP3 chapter markers soon.</p>
                <p><strong>Update:</strong> iOS 12 <a href="https://twitter.com/tpritc/status/1004336257651134464">now supports MP3 chapter markers</a> on iOS. When it's released (expected in September 2018), the most used podcast client in the world will support MP3 chapter markers!</p>

                <h3>What ID3 version does Podcast Chapters use?</h3>
                <p>Podcast Chapters uses ID3 v2.3 throughout, even if the file that's imported uses a different ID3 tag (or doesn't have one at all).</p>

                <h3>Can I add other podcast metadata in Podcast Chapters?</h3>
                <p>As of Podcast Chapters 1.2, you can now set the following non-chapter metadata in your podcasts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Podcast title</li>
                    <li>Podcast authors</li>
                    <li>Podcast artwork</li>
                    <li>Episode title</li>
                    <li>Episode summary</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Does Podcast Chapters support individual chapter artwork?</h3>
                <p>As of Podcast Chapters 1.2, you can now add individual chapter artwork. In compatible podcast clients, this will show up as the show art during the time period of the chapter..</p>

                <h3>Can I import markers from [some format]?</h3>
                <p>Podcast Chapters 1.2 supports importing chapter markers from <code>cue</code> files. You can import markers using the menu, by selecting 'Import Chapters...' from the 'Chapter' menu, and selecting a <code>cue</code> file.</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>The <code>cue</code> files only support importing the title and the timestamp of a chapter, and if you want to add a URL or an image to the chapter, you will need to do that manually in Podcast Chapters.</p>
                <p>Support for <code>csv</code> files is on the way, and if you'd like another format supported, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/tpritc">reach out to me</a>.</p>

                <p>The best place to ask a question is on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/tpritc">@tpritc</a>), or if you'd rather, you can <a href="mailto:hi@tpritc.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
